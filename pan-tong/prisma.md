PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) is a widely adopted framework for conducting rigorous systematic literature reviews (SLRs). Below is a **PRISMA-aligned adaptation** of your article structure, including methodological details and refined RQs. I’ll also include a PRISMA flow diagram template and key steps to ensure compliance.

### **PRISMA-Compliant Article Structure**  
**Title:** *Cognitive Multi-Agent Systems with LLM-Driven Social Dynamics for Adaptive Classroom Interaction Simulation: A Systematic Literature Review*  

#### **1. Introduction**  
- **Objective**: Define the scope of the SLR and its relevance to adaptive classroom simulations.  
- **Rationale**: Highlight gaps in existing CMAS research (e.g., lack of LLM integration for social dynamics).  
- **PRISMA Alignment**: Explicitly state adherence to PRISMA guidelines (cite the [PRISMA 2020 statement](https://prisma-statement.org/)).  

#### **2. Methods**  
*(PRISMA focuses on transparency here)*  

**2.1. Search Strategy**  
- **Databases**: Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, PubMed, and ERIC.  
- **Keywords**:  
  - ("cognitive multi-agent systems" OR "CMAS")  
  - ("large language models" OR "LLMs" OR "GPT" OR "transformer models")  
  - ("social dynamics" OR "classroom interaction" OR "adaptive simulation")  
  - ("education technology" OR "pedagogical agents")  
- **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria**:  
  - **Inclusion**: Peer-reviewed articles (2018–2023), English language, focus on CMAS, LLMs, or classroom simulations.  
  - **Exclusion**: Non-empirical studies, non-educational contexts, outdated agent models (pre-2015).  

**2.2. Study Selection**  
- **Screening Process**:  
  1. Duplicate removal.  
  2. Title/abstract screening (by two reviewers).  
  3. Full-text review for eligibility.  
- **PRISMA Flow Diagram**: Include a visual summary of study selection (template below).  

**2.3. Data Extraction**  
- **Variables**:  
  - Author/year, methodology, CMAS architecture, LLM integration approach, evaluation metrics, key findings.  
  - Use tools like Rayyan or Covidence for collaboration.  

**2.4. Risk of Bias Assessment**  
- Use tools like AXIS (for cross-sectional studies) or MMAT (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool).  
- Focus on biases in LLM training data, simulation validity, and generalizability.  

**2.5. Synthesis Method**  
- Thematic analysis (e.g., coding for "LLM-driven dialogue," "adaptive pedagogy," "agent collaboration").  
- Compare frameworks (e.g., BDI agents vs. LLM-augmented agents).  

#### **3. Results**  
- **PRISMA Flow Diagram**:  
  ![PRISMA Flow Diagram Template](https://prisma-statement.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PRISMA-2020-Flow-Diagram-2x2.png)  
  *(Replace with your own diagram showing records identified, screened, excluded, and included)*  

- **Key Findings**:  
  - Trends in LLM integration (e.g., GPT-3 for student-agent dialogue).  
  - Gaps in ethical safeguards for LLM-driven classroom agents.  
  - Metrics for evaluating adaptive simulations (e.g., engagement scores, learning gains).  

#### **4. Discussion**  
- **Alignment with RQs**:  
  - RQ1: How LLMs enhance CMAS realism (e.g., natural language generation for peer interactions).  
  - RQ2: Frameworks and limitations (e.g., scalability vs. computational cost).  
  - RQ3: Metrics for success (e.g., combining quantitative outcomes with qualitative social dynamics).  
- **PRISMA Compliance**: Highlight how the review addressed bias and reproducibility.  

#### **5. Conclusion**  
- Summarize implications for education technology and CMAS design.  
- Recommend future work (e.g., longitudinal studies, cross-cultural validation).  

### **Refined Research Questions (PRISMA-Aligned)**  
1. **RQ1**: How do LLM-driven social dynamics improve the realism and adaptability of CMAS in educational simulations compared to traditional agent models?  
   *(PRISMA focus: Compare outcomes across studies)*  

2. **RQ2**: What methodological frameworks and ethical challenges emerge in integrating LLMs into CMAS for classroom simulations?  
   *(PRISMA focus: Identify patterns and biases in existing approaches)*  

3. **RQ3**: What metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-driven CMAS in classroom simulations, and how do they balance educational and social outcomes?  
   *(PRISMA focus: Synthesize evaluation strategies)*  

### **PRISMA Checklist**  
Include a completed [PRISMA 2020 checklist](https://prisma-statement.org/documents/PRISMA2020Checklist.docx) in your submission to ensure all items (e.g., search strategy, risk of bias) are addressed.
