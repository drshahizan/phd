# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 3: Methodology â€“ Detailed Feedback


### ðŸ“Œ **1. Research Design**

#### ðŸ”Ž Weakness:
- The chapter does not explicitly justify **why a quantitative approach** is used over qualitative or mixed methods.
- There's no strong linkage between the **research objectives/questions** and the chosen design.

#### âœ… Recommendations:
- Clearly explain **why quantitative survey** is the most appropriate method for this studyâ€”e.g., suitable for testing technology adoption models like TAM/UTAUT.
- Use a phrase like:  
  > "This research adopts a quantitative design due to its ability to test hypothesized relationships between latent variables in a structured and generalizable way."

- Provide a table aligning **each research objective** with the **research question, hypothesis, and data collection method**.

### ðŸ“Œ **2. Population, Sampling, and Sample Size**

#### ðŸ”Ž Weakness:
- Sampling method is mentioned (simple random), but **population size and sampling frame are vague**.
- No statistical justification (e.g., G*Power or Krejcie & Morgan table) is given for the sample size.

#### âœ… Recommendations:
- Define the **target population** precisely (e.g., final-year students from 5 federal polytechnics).
- Explain the **sampling process**, e.g., stratified by institution or program?
- Include a statistical formula or tool to justify your sample size.

**Example**:
> The sample size of 380 was determined using the Krejcie and Morgan (1970) formula for a population size of approximately 10,000 students with a 95% confidence level.

### ðŸ“Œ **3. Instrumentation**

#### ðŸ”Ž Weakness:
- The questionnaire constructs are not clearly mapped to **previous studies or validated instruments**.
- Some constructs may lack operational definitions or references.

#### âœ… Recommendations:
- Provide a **table mapping each construct to source articles**, item counts, and measurement scale used (e.g., 5-point Likert scale).
- Clearly state if **items were adapted or adopted**, and what validation process (e.g., expert review, pilot test) was conducted.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **4. Validity and Reliability**

#### ðŸ”Ž Weakness:
- There is **no detailed plan for testing construct validity**, including convergent, discriminant, and content validity.
- Reliability is mentioned (Cronbachâ€™s alpha), but thresholds and decision criteria are not specified.

#### âœ… Recommendations:
- Outline a clear **measurement model validation plan**:
  - **Content validity** via expert review
  - **Construct validity** via Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
  - **Convergent validity** using Average Variance Extracted (AVE > 0.5)
  - **Discriminant validity** using Fornell-Larcker criterion or HTMT ratio
- Clarify that Cronbachâ€™s alpha > 0.7 indicates acceptable internal consistency.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **5. Data Analysis Techniques**

#### ðŸ”Ž Weakness:
- The mention of PLS-SEM is appropriate but not well justified.
- There's no step-by-step breakdown of **how PLS-SEM will be applied** (e.g., model evaluation stages).

#### âœ… Recommendations:
- Justify PLS-SEM due to:
  - Model complexity
  - Non-normal data tolerance
  - Predictive focus
- Outline analysis stages:
  1. Outer model assessment (reliability and validity)
  2. Inner model assessment (path coefficients, RÂ², effect size, predictive relevance)
  3. Hypothesis testing (bootstrapping)

---

### ðŸ“Œ **6. Ethical Considerations**

#### ðŸ”Ž Weakness:
- Briefly mentioned with no details about **confidentiality, voluntary participation, or data protection**.
  
#### âœ… Recommendations:
- Expand the section to include:
  - Ethical clearance from university
  - Informed consent
  - Anonymous data handling
  - Secure data storage

## ðŸ“ˆ Reflection: Alignment with Information Systems (IS) Research Steps

A robust IS research methodology typically follows these steps:

| **Step** | **Your Chapter** | **Comment** |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **1. Define research problem** | Covered in Chapter 1 | âœ“ Good |
| **2. Establish theoretical foundation** | Partial in Chapter 2 | Needs stronger model justification |
| **3. Develop research model & hypotheses** | Implicit | Needs to be explicitly stated in Chapter 3 |
| **4. Select research methods** | Quantitative method chosen | âœ“ Valid, but needs better justification |
| **5. Design instrument** | Survey described | Needs construct mapping and reference to validated instruments |
| **6. Collect data** | Planned | Sampling frame & method need clarification |
| **7. Analyze data** | PLS-SEM proposed | âœ“ Good choice, but execution plan should be detailed |
| **8. Interpret results** | (Expected in Chapter 4) | Not yet done |
| **9. Contribute to theory & practice** | (Expected in Chapter 5) | Not yet done |

## âœ… Final Suggestions

1. Include a **summary diagram or table** showing the overall methodology flow.
2. Add **hypothesis statements** based on your model at the end of Chapter 3.
3. Clarify your **measurement model and evaluation criteria** for SEM.
4. Strengthen **construct reliability and validity strategy** with references.
5. Ensure that all constructs are clearly defined and traceable to theory.
