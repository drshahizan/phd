## 📚 Chapter 2: Literature Review – Detailed Feedback

### 📘 **1. Structure and Organization**

#### 🔎 Weakness:
- The chapter lacks a clear organizational structure or thematic roadmap.
- Subsections appear disjointed without a logical flow from general to specific topics (e.g., AI → Generative AI → Adoption Models → Nigeria context).

#### ✅ Recommendations:
- Restructure the chapter into major thematic areas such as:
  1. Overview of AI in Education
  2. Generative AI and Learning Tools
  3. Technology Adoption Models (TAM, UTAUT, TOE, etc.)
  4. Factors Influencing Technology Adoption in Education
  5. Related Studies in Nigeria/Africa
  6. Research Gap and Theoretical Justification

Include an introductory paragraph for each section to explain its relevance to your study.

### 📘 **2. Review of Generative AI in Education**

#### 🔎 Weakness:
- Although the chapter references AI broadly, it doesn't sufficiently explain **Generative AI** and its relevance to students’ academic performance.
- There is little discussion about tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc., that are directly related to your thesis topic.

#### ✅ Recommendations:
- Define generative AI clearly with recent references (e.g., OpenAI, academic articles 2023–2025).
- Discuss practical educational use cases: automated feedback, assignment help, content generation, coding assistance.
- Link these tools to **specific learning outcomes** or student behaviors in higher education.

**Example**:
> Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT have transformed learning environments by enabling real-time tutoring, improving writing skills, and personalizing student experiences (Zhan & Yan, 2025).

### 📘 **3. Theoretical Foundation**

#### 🔎 Weakness:
- The chapter briefly mentions TAM and UTAUT but lacks depth in **justifying model selection** and explaining core constructs (e.g., perceived ease of use, facilitating conditions, etc.).
- There's no **conceptual comparison** of different models or a rationale for integrating elements from multiple theories.

#### ✅ Recommendations:
- Clearly explain the **constructs** of each model you intend to use (TAM, UTAUT, TOE, etc.).
- Discuss previous studies that have used these models in education or AI-related contexts.
- Justify your own conceptual model (which constructs are included, which are modified, and why).
- Include a **comparison table** of adoption models to show strengths, limitations, and suitability for your context.

### 📘 **4. Contextual Relevance to Nigeria / Polytechnics**

#### 🔎 Weakness:
- The review is heavily global in focus. There is little engagement with **African or Nigerian studies** on AI, digital education, or student performance.
- Important local barriers such as infrastructure, digital literacy, or institutional support are not critically reviewed.

#### ✅ Recommendations:
- Include a dedicated section titled “Technology Adoption in Nigerian Higher Education” or similar.
- Review local studies on:
  - E-learning platforms
  - AI readiness or digital gaps
  - Institutional policies in Nigerian polytechnics

**Tip**: Use grey literature where necessary (e.g., government reports, World Bank education stats, NUC documents).

### 📘 **5. Research Gap and Theoretical Justification**

#### 🔎 Weakness:
- The research gap is stated vaguely and appears at the end of the chapter without a strong buildup.
- There is no critical synthesis showing what past studies have missed or done differently.

#### ✅ Recommendations:
- End the chapter with a **"Synthesis and Identified Gaps"** section.
- Compare multiple studies and state what has not been addressed (e.g., few adoption models tailored to polytechnic students using generative AI).
- Justify your model’s uniqueness—what does it offer that others do not?

**Example**:
> While TAM and UTAUT have been widely applied to study digital tools in higher education, limited research exists on their application to generative AI in Nigerian polytechnics. This study bridges this gap by adapting these models with variables specific to local challenges.

### 📘 **6. Citation Quality and Use of Sources**

#### 🔎 Weakness:
- Many references are outdated (before 2020) or non-peer-reviewed.
- Key claims are presented without citations, especially in sections discussing AI benefits.

#### ✅ Recommendations:
- Replace older references with **2021–2025** peer-reviewed articles from Scopus, WoS, or IEEE.
- Use APA 7th edition formatting consistently.
- Include more empirical studies that support AI adoption outcomes in education.

---

### 📘 **7. Writing Style and Academic Tone**

#### 🔎 Weakness:
- The writing style is often informal and repetitive.
- Sentences are long and could benefit from better academic phrasing.

#### ✅ Recommendations:
- Revise with an academic tone: concise, objective, and third-person.
- Remove redundancy; avoid stating the same idea with different words.
- Use headings, subheadings, and transitions for clarity.

## ✅ **Next Steps / Optional Additions**

- ✅ Include **Figure 2.1**: A visual conceptual framework (can be a draft now; final in Chapter 3).
- ✅ Provide a **table of reviewed studies** with variables, methods, findings, and gaps.
- ✅ Consider reviewing **resistance to AI** (from Innovation Resistance Theory or IRT) if applicable in your model.
