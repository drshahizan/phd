## 📊 EVALUATION OF YOUR MODEL FOR IS RESEARCH

### ✅ **1. Relevance to IS Discipline**

#### ✅ What’s Good:
- You focus on *technology adoption*—a central theme in IS.
- The context is institutional (polytechnics), involving users, technologies, and performance outcomes, which aligns well with the IS triad: **technology**, **people**, and **processes**.

#### 📌 Recommendation:
> Your model is **suitable** for IS, provided it has a **clear integration** of IS theories and addresses both behavioral and performance-based outcomes.

---

### ⚠️ **2. Theoretical Rigor and Foundation**

#### 🔎 Weakness:
- Your model appears to draw from TAM/UTAUT but lacks a strong explanation of *why* these models are chosen.
- There's no synthesis of constructs from multiple models (e.g., IRT, TOE) to enrich the generative AI context.
- Constructs like **behavioral intention, usage, performance improvement** are mentioned, but **the mediators or moderators are unclear**.

#### ✅ Recommendations:
- **Anchor your model** in one or more IS theories. For example:
  - TAM (Davis, 1989)
  - UTAUT (Venkatesh et al., 2003)
  - TOE Framework (Tornatzky and Fleischer, 1990)
  - IRT (Ram & Sheth, 1989) – for resistance dimension
- **Justify the inclusion** of each construct:
  - Why “institutional support”?
  - Why “perceived usefulness” for generative AI specifically?
  - What about “trust in AI” or “digital literacy”?
- Discuss **interactions** (e.g., Does institutional support moderate the effect of perceived usefulness on intention?)

---

### 📉 **3. Model Completeness**

#### 🔎 Weakness:
- Your current model focuses heavily on *intention to use* generative AI but does not explain *actual use*, *resistance*, or *post-adoption outcomes* (e.g., performance impact, sustained usage).

#### ✅ Recommendations:
- Include constructs like:
  - **Actual usage behavior**
  - **Perceived learning performance**
  - **Resistance to change** (from IRT)
  - **Self-efficacy or digital competence**
- You may structure the model like this:

```text
Facilitators (Institutional Support, Digital Literacy)
         ↓
   Core TAM Constructs (PU, PEOU)
         ↓
   Behavioral Intention → Actual Usage
         ↓
   Academic Performance (Outcome)
```

Optionally include **moderators** such as:
- **ICT infrastructure quality**
- **Student prior exposure to AI tools**

---

### 📚 **4. Contribution to IS Knowledge**

#### 🔎 Weakness:
- The model’s **contribution to IS theory is not emphasized**. It is not enough to apply an existing model—you must *adapt*, *extend*, or *validate* it in a new context.

#### ✅ Recommendations:
- Make your model *contextually adaptive*: Nigerian polytechnics have unique sociotechnical constraints.
- Highlight the **novelty**: For example, “this study extends UTAUT by integrating performance-based outcomes and resistance variables within a generative AI context in developing countries.”

---

### 📈 **5. Empirical Testability**

#### ✅ What’s Good:
- Your constructs seem measurable and survey-ready, which is important for IS empirical research.

#### 📌 Suggestion:
- Ensure each construct has **clear operational definitions** and aligns with validated instruments in IS literature.
- Plan for **model validation** via PLS-SEM or CB-SEM with sufficient sample size.

## ✅ IS YOUR MODEL ENOUGH FOR A PhD IN IS?

| Criterion                          | Status               | Comment |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Relevance to IS domain**        | ✅ Suitable           | Focuses on technology adoption in institutional settings |
| **Grounded in IS Theory**         | ⚠️ Needs strengthening | TAM/UTAUT used, but poorly justified and not adapted |
| **Model originality**             | ⚠️ Weak               | Must integrate or extend existing models for new insights |
| **Empirical testability**         | ✅ Acceptable         | Constructs are survey-ready |
| **Contribution to knowledge**     | ⚠️ Needs work         | Clearly state theoretical and practical contributions |

## 🎯 Final Recommendations

1. **Refine and extend** your model with context-sensitive variables (e.g., digital divide, infrastructure readiness).
2. Provide a **visual diagram** of your model.
3. Add a **summary table** of constructs with definitions, sources, and rationale.
4. Include **a section comparing your model to past models** and highlighting your enhancements.
