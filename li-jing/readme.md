Then a **focal loss (FL) function** is introduced into the LightGBM classifier to boost the learning of difficult samples. Finally, a two-stage prediction step with LightGBM and autoencoder is performed. In the first stage, pre-decision is conducted with LightGBM. In the second stage, a residual is used to make a secondary decision for samples with a normal class.

[Hybrid Intrusion Detection System Based on Combination of Random Forest and Autoencoder](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/15/3/568) by Chao Wang et al., 2023, symmetry, MDPI
- Problem: difficult to deal with unknown attacks, high false positive rate
- Keyword: intrusion detection; random forest; autoencoder; hybrid model; unknown attack
- Idea: As different models learn data characteristics from different perspectives, in this work we propose a hybrid IDS which leverages both random forest (RF) and autoencoder (AE).
- Methodology: The hybrid model operates in two steps. In particular, in the first step, we utilize the probability output of the RF classifier to determine whether a sample belongs to attack. The unknown attacks can be identified with the assistance of the probability output. In the second step, an additional AE is coupled to reduce the false positive rate. To simulate an unknown attack in experiments, we explicitly remove some samples belonging to one attack class from the training set.
- Datasets: IDS2018, BOT-IOT
- Classification: binary classification
- Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and FAR
- Results: The experimental results prove that the combina- tion method boosts the detection rate and reduces the FPR in comparison to the single detection methods.
- Future directions: Only one type of attack was set as the unknown during the experiments; it is important to set **more than one type of attack** as the unknown to test the model. We plan to expand the method into a **multi-class approach** to provide more diagnostic information for security operators in the future.
- My comments: an approach on handling unknown attack, and reducing false positive rate.

- Idea: propose a **collaborative learning** based detection framework called ADCL, which can mitigate the limitations on the knowledge of a single model by **leveraging multiple models trained in similar environments and detecting intrusions in a collaborative manner**.
- Results: Our evaluation results indicate that ADCL can provide better performance compared with a single model on detecting various attacks in IoT networks. Specifically, ADCL improves F-score by up to 80% for adaptability, 42% in mitigating the reliance on learning integrity, 85% for model capacity. Furthermore, the detection results of ADCL guide those single models to update and increase the F-score by 15%.
- Future directions: 
- My comments: Interesting idea, a model selection mechanism with mulitple models tranined, using suitable detector for attack detection.

Review: [Zero-day attack detection: a systematic literature review](https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.utm.my/article/10.1007/s10462-023-10437-z) by Rasheed Ahmad et al., Artificial Intelligence Review (2023)
- Problem: Many of the recently proposed solutions lack a holistic IDS approach due to explicitly **relying on attack signature repositories, outdated datasets or the lack of considering zero-day (unknown) attacks while developing, training, or testing the machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL)-based models**. Overlooking these factors makes the proposed IDS **less robust or practical in real-time environments**. On the other hand, detecting **zero-day attacks is a challenging subject**, despite the many solutions proposed over the past many years.
- Keyword: Zero-day attacks · Unknown attacks · Anomaly detection · Intrusion detection · Closed and open set recognition
- Idea: **SLR from the point of view on zero-day attacks in IDS.** One of the goals of this systematic literature review (SLR) is to provide a research asset to future researchers on **various methodologies, techniques, ML and DL algorithms that researchers used for the detection of zero-day attacks.**
- Results: completing the gap in providing a single repository of finding ML and DL-based tools and techniques used by researchers for the detection of zero-day attacks.
- Future directions: **Not all attacks require the same mitigation strategy.** some other researchers grouped various subclasses of attacks into a few main **attack classes.** ML and DL models must be trained and tested on the diverse dataset to avoid training or testing bias issues and achieve optimum performance results on zero-day attacks. **Quality datasets** play a major role in building a comprehensive IDS. When building a DL-based model, it is essential to **consider factors (e.g., memory, computational power, deployment layer) that can impact the model performance in a live environment.** 
- My comments: this paper provide a guide for the methods and techniques to build IDS towards zero-day attacks.

[Fog-cloud based intrusion detection system using Recurrent Neural Networks and feature selection for IoT networks](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.utm.my/science/article/pii/S138912862300107X) by Naeem Firdous Syed et al., Computer Networks Volume 225, April 2023, 109662
- Problem: Deep learning techniques perform better in detecting attacks compared to shallow machine learning algorithms and can be used for intrusion detection. However, communication overheads due to large volume of IoT data and computation requirements for deep learning models prevents effective application of deep learning models closer to the constrained devices. **Existing IDS techniques are either based on shallow learning algorithms or not trained on relevant IoT datasets and furthermore not designed for distributed fog-cloud deployment.**
- Keyword: IoT, Fog-cloud, Deep learning, IDS
- Idea: proposed a novel fog-cloud based IoT intrusion detection framework which incorporates **a distributed processing** by **splitting the dataset according to attack class** and **a feature selection step on time-series IoT data.** This is followed by a deep learning **Recurrent Neural Network (SimpleRNN and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM))** for attack detection.
- Sub-idea: This is achieved by **first splitting the time-series based IoT network data according to the attack class, where a multi-class problem is converted to binary class problem.** This is followed by applying simple feature reduction techniques such as Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Mutual Information (MI) and Chi-Square Statistic to reduce the data size for training the DL models. The reduced datasets are then uploaded to a cloud node to train the DL algorithm and an optimised DL model is deployed to the edge or fog nodes for detecting IoT attacks. (good to refer!)
- Methodology: DL: SimpleRNN, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), FS: GMDH-LR-COV, GMDH-LR, MI, Chi-Sqr.

- Datasets: BOT-IOT
- Environment: A high performance computing (HPC) cluster with 8 GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU running on Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5120 CPU @ 2.20 GHz with 256 GB memory was deployed to run the experiments. TensorFlow library and Keras libraries were used for implementing the SimpleRNN and bi-directional LSTM modules. 
- Classification: splitting the dataset according to classes, so transform from multi-classification into binary classification.
- Metrics: Dataset size, accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Time to train (s)
- Results: Results show that feature selection methods significantly **reduced the dataset size by 90%** under the computation requirements without compromising on the attack detection ability. The models built on reduced dataset achieved **higher recall rate compared to models trained on full feature** set without loosing class differentiation ability. The SimpleRNN and Bi-LSTM models also **did not suffer any underfitting or overfitting with the reduced feature space.** The proposed deep learning based IoT intrusion detection framework is **suitable for fog-cloud based deployment and can scale well even with large volumes of IoT data.**
- Future directions: /
- My comments: Fog-based architecture with model trainined, validated and tested in cloud and model deployed at fog level closer to IoT devices to reduce latency of attack detection, DL for high performance, Four FS for dimensionality reduction, BoT-IoT for comprehensive IoT scenarios, comparison with that of full features. **Dataset spliting step is very interesting!**

- Application: Industrial Control Systems(ICS), vulnerability on Modbus protocol (DDoS attack)
- Problem: Traditional detection methods **cannot perform well on fine-grained detection tasks** which could contribute to locating targets of attacks and preventing the destruction.
- Keyword: ICS · Modbus · DoS · DDoS · Deep learning · Fine-grained classification
- Idea: proposed a Neural Network architecture named MODLSTM, which consists of three parts: input preprocessing, feature recoding, and traffic classification.
- Dataset: CICDDOS2019
- Methodology: PCA for visualization, LSTM
- Validation: Confusion matrix of (a)Binary (b)Multiclassy task, Recall Precision Accuracy Class number

The results show that the proposed method has more satisfactory abilities to detect **DoS attacks related to Modbus**, compared with other works. 
- Future directions:  However, the experiments **just involved some serial attacks**, in our real world, there are many **malicious attacks happening in parallel**. The first is to explore a dataset for parallel network attacks in Modbus devices, and discuss appropriate classifications method. On this basis, we will construct a more robust ICS firewall capable of facing multiple attack modes.

- Validation: Confusion matrix of (a)Binary (b)Multiclassy task, Recall Precision Accuracy Class number
- Environment: We implemented the proposed deep ensemble-based IDS model in Python 3.7 with Tensorflow 2.6. to validate the efficacy of the proposed architecture. The experiment was done on a core-i5 machine with 64-bit Operating System (OS) and 16GB RAM. The software stack con- tained Java (JDK) 11, Hadoop 2.7, Spark v3.0, Pyspark 3.0, and Kafka 2.6.  
- Results: The proposed approach gives high accuracy of over 99.93% and saves useful processing time due to the **multi-pronged classification strategy and using the lambda architecture.** We also demonstrate that the **ensemble approach results in higher detection accuracy and precision as compared to using the simple approach.** We also demonstrate that using the Lambda architecture enhances system performance in terms of throughput.  
- Future directions: In the future, we intend to employ **more deep-learning approaches in the ensemble model** to augment detection accuracy and system performance further. We also intend to test the proposed framework **in a real-world production IoT environment** to validate its performance further. Another important goal is to use **Automated Machine Learning techniques for tuning the hyperparameters.**  
- My comments: quick binary and ensemble multi-classification, Lamda architecuture used considering IoT characteristics.

[BLoCNet: a hybrid, dataset-independent intrusion detection system using deep learning](https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.utm.my/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00663-5) by Brandon Bowen et al., International Journal of Information Security (2023)
- Problem: Most models achieve high accuracy, they may **not always detect underrepresented attacks**. Also, their **accuracy depends on the dataset, its features, and the proportion of samples**.
- Keyword: Cybersecurity · Intrusion detection · Deep learning · CNN · BLSTM
- Idea: Quick binary classifier CNN + hybrid classifiers for identifying specific attacks. This paper proposes BLoCNet, **a hybrid DL model** that combines **convolutional neural network (CNN)** and **bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) layers**. CNN allows the IDS to recognize patterns in the features of the network data **in a fast computation time**. The results are sent to two BLSTM layers, which capitalize on the forward and backward propagation of data to **identify malicious traffic.**
- Dataset: CIC-IDS2017, IoT-23, Bot-IoT, and UNSW-NB15 (why paper named dataset-independent...)
- Classifier: CNN and BLSTM
- Methodology: SMOTE, undersampling for class imbalance.
- <img width="821" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22785858/223058968-fbdd8bd2-5ecf-434f-ab8f-0ed5aacadba6.png">
- Validation: Prec Recall F1 Minority, minority attack classes were specified in test result.
- Results: For CIC-IDS2017 and IoT-23 datasets, BLoCNet had an accuracy of 98% and 99%, which is similar performance as related studies, albeit not an exact comparison due to different sampling approaches. For the original UNSW-NB15 dataset, BLoCNet had an accuracy of 76.34% vs. 75.56% of related work. These results demonstrate that BLoCNet performed well **across various datasets and confirms that its hybrid model provides good detection results.** albeit not an exact comparison **due to different sampling approaches.**   
- Future directions: we will further explore the performance of BLoCNet and the DNN model. This can help **reduce the training time of the BLoCNet model** and understand how to improve the **detection rate for underrepresented attacks**. The latter can be achieved by using **different sampling techniques**. BLoCNet can also be trained on **newer IoT datasets**, as it is **dataset agnostic**.  
- My comments: Hybrid model across multiple datasets, or named dataset agnositic model, especially for the minority attacks (by using sampling techniques). Implications for practitioners section contains the brief experience on data pre-processing and model validation.
