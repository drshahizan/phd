### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ˜„ My name is Jing, and I'm pursuing a PhD in computer science at UTM.
- I'm currently working on an intelligent security framework for the IoT ecosystem, utilising machine learning and deep learning. 
- In order to implement this security model, a wide range of multidisciplinary expertise, including cyber security, the internet of things, intrusion detection and prevention, anomaly detection, machine learning, and deep learning, must be studied and put into practise.
- As a result, I'd like to thank github for providing a platform for me to create and manage multiple knowledge repositories. 

ðŸ“š Here are some topics in my repos:

- ðŸ“š [The Things of PhD Journey](https://github.com/goldboy225/PhD-Journey): All the things involving research knowledge, publication, practical skills, awesome courses, domain area expertise, and all the necessary and interesting things will be collected and synthesized for who want to try and pursue the PhD journey (will keep updating).
- ðŸ”­ [Code Base for Research](https://github.com/goldboy225/Code-Base-for-Research): The coding practice involving data cleaning, data visualization, exploration data analysis, feature selection, machine learning and deep learning.
- ðŸ“« [ChatGPT for Research](https://github.com/goldboy225/ChatGPT-for-Research): Repo for the stuff that created by ChatGPT, let's see how ChatGPT can help on research work.
- ðŸŒ± [Construction of IoT Security Frameworks](https://github.com/goldboy225/Intelligent-IoT-Security-Frameworks): This is the coding practice repo of constructing end-to-end machine learning and deep learning-based security frameworks for IoT security.
- ðŸ‘¯ [Cyber Security](https://github.com/goldboy225/cyber-security): This is the coding repo related to cyber security involving network intrusion detection using well-known datasets like KDD cup â€˜99, NSL-KDD, UNSW_NB15.
- ðŸ“« [Awesome ML for Cybersecurity](https://github.com/goldboy225/awesome-ml-for-cybersecurity): A curated list of amazingly awesome tools and resources related to the use of machine learning for cyber security.

ðŸ“š The plan to be accomplished:
1. [Proposal writing and defense has been completed](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1htEHWofGPdG0_bB_OxUMkcLycj0pf5DZ)
2. [SLR articles writing is on the way](https://github.com/users/drshahizan/projects/1/views/2)
3. [Experimental papers is under the plan and to be written](https://github.com/users/drshahizan/projects/1/views/1)
4. Balabala...
