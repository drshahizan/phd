### Structural Focus
Align the thesis around the proposed MIS model and its validation.
- Merge Chapters 4 and 5 into a single “Results and Analysis” that links findings directly to hypotheses.
- Centralize the model in Chapter 4 with tightly mapped constructs, hypotheses, and instrument items.
- Remove redundant methods content and align phases directly to objectives for traceable logic.
### Model Differentiation
Establish novelty via people-centric determinants over system/technical quality.
- Combine UTAUT and DeLone–McLean with training and management support to target human levers.
- Define “effectiveness” operationally and retitle to emphasize a user-related conceptual model for China’s higher education.
- Compare against closest prior models to justify construct selection and linkages.
### Validation Rigor
Prove practical validity with evidence beyond construct checks.
- Use interviews, diverse faculty/staff data, and survey correlations as criteria for factor selection.
- Quantify expert feedback and reference established validation methods and instrument choices.
- Protect privacy with anonymized appendices and summarized outputs.
### Scope and Gap
Focus the research on the overlooked ordinary universities and justify site selection.
- Narrow questions to training and management support within MIS effectiveness.
- Articulate the gap in UTAUT-based studies and justify Hebei University with context-specific reasons.
- Add comparative discussion across tiers, provinces, and beyond Malaysia.
