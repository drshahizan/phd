## TL;DR
A panel of examiners conducts a comprehensive review of a PhD candidate's research on the adoption of Management Information Systems (MIS) in ordinary Chinese universities. The student proposes a new hybrid model combining the UTAUT and D&M frameworks, adding 'training' and 'management support' as key variables to address a research gap. The examiners challenge the student on multiple fronts, demanding stronger justification for the variable selection, a more rigorous validation methodology, and a clearer articulation of the research's novelty and practical application. They provide extensive feedback for restructuring the thesis, including rewriting the problem statement, combining the results and discussion chapters, and revising the title and abstract to accurately reflect the study's contribution, which is the development of a new conceptual model rather than a measurement of effectiveness.
## Introduction
- **Zhu Linnan (The PhD Candidate):** The author of the research, presenting and defending their work. Their core argument is that ordinary universities in China face unique MIS implementation challenges (e.g., lack of funding, outdated management) that are not addressed by existing models. They propose a new model focused on faculty/staff users, incorporating 'training' and 'management support' to address these gaps.
- **Dr Roliana (Examiner/Methodological Advisor):** A key panelist providing critical, structured feedback. They focus on methodological rigor, questioning the justification for variable selection, the sample size for interviews, the model validation process, and the clarity of the problem statement. They also suggest major structural revisions to the thesis, such as combining chapters and reframing the limitations section.
- **Prof Jafreezal (Examiner/Primary Critic):** Another main panelist who probes the practical application and analytical depth of the research. They challenge the sufficiency of the evidence (e.g., using only four expert interviews to select variables), the distinction between the proposed model and similar existing ones, and the need for a more robust, quantifiable validation method.
- **Prof Azlan (Moderator):** Manages the flow of the discussion, guiding the review from a general Q&A to a chapter-by-chapter and section-by-section critique, including the abstract, appendices, and title.
- **Speaker 8 (Examiner):** Focuses on structural and ethical aspects of the paper, raising questions about the correct placement of content (e.g., sample size justification) and the need to ensure respondent privacy by anonymizing data in the appendices.
- **Speakers 2, 6, 7:** Other participants who largely listen, agree with the panel's feedback, and ask minor clarifying questions.
## Key Points
1. **Core Research Problem & Contribution:** The research addresses the ineffective implementation of Management Information Systems (MIS) in "ordinary" Chinese universities, which lack the resources of top-tier institutions. The main contribution is a new hybrid model combining the UTAUT and D&M frameworks, with the addition of 'training' and 'management support' as user-related determinants.
2. **Weak Justification for Variables:** A major point of contention is the justification for selecting 'training' and 'management support'. The examiners find the student's reliance on a literature review and interviews with only four experts to be insufficient and not rigorous enough for a PhD-level study.
3. **Insufficient Model Validation:** The validation process, based on qualitative feedback from a small number of experts, is deemed inadequate. The panel strongly recommends a more robust, quantifiable method to validate the final model's predictive power and prove its contribution.
4. **Unclear Problem Statement & Scope:** The student's problem statement, research questions, and objectives are considered too broad and not sufficiently focused on the specific issues of training and management support. The rationale for focusing on Hebei province also requires stronger justification beyond simply having the most ordinary universities.
5. **Required Thesis Restructuring:** The panel recommends a major overhaul of the thesis structure for logical flow. This includes creating a new chapter dedicated to the proposed model's development, combining the separate data analysis and discussion chapters, and moving the hypothesis development section.
6. **Refinement of Final Sections:** The abstract is too general and must be rewritten to be specific about the mixed-methodology, findings, and novelty. The title is misleading ("effectiveness") and must be changed to reflect the study's actual outcome: the development of a conceptual or determinant model. Appendices must be anonymized to protect respondent privacy.
## Summary of Discussion
The discussion began with the examiners questioning the fundamental aspects of the research. The student (Zhu Linnan) explained that their study addresses a gap in the literature, which has historically focused on MIS implementation in top-tier universities, neglecting the unique challenges of "ordinary" universities in China, particularly in Hebei province. The core of their contribution is a new hybrid model that combines the UTAUT and D&M models and introduces 'training' and 'management support' as critical variables to address both user-level resistance and organizational-level failures.
The examiners (primarily Speakers 3 and 5) immediately challenged the methodology behind this contribution. They argued that the process for selecting 'training' and 'management support' over other potential factors was not clearly justified. The student revealed that the choice was based on literature reviews and interviews with four university experts (deans), which the panel deemed insufficient evidence for a PhD thesis, suggesting a preliminary survey would have been more convincing.
The critique then expanded to the research's framing. The examiners found the problem statement too general and advised rewriting it to focus specifically on the gaps related to training and management support. They also demanded a clearer definition of "effectiveness" and a stronger justification for choosing Hebei province as the research scope.
The panel proceeded to review the thesis chapter by chapter, providing extensive, actionable feedback.
- **Chapters 1 & 2 (Introduction & Literature Review):** The panel advised the student to move preliminary findings out of the introduction and into the results section. They stressed the need for the literature review to be more analytical, requiring the student to explicitly compare their proposed model to the most similar existing models (identified as #11 and #28 in their review table) and justify the differences, particularly concerning the choice of user group (faculty/staff vs. students) and determinant variables.
- **Chapter 3 (Methodology):** The panel criticized the lack of clarity in the model validation process. They questioned the phases of the research, from instrument design to the final validated framework. The qualitative validation by a few experts was considered weak, and the panel pushed for a more rigorous, quantifiable method to confirm the model's value.
- **Chapters 4 & 5 (Analysis & Discussion):** The examiners identified a confusing structure and recommended a major overhaul. They proposed creating a new Chapter 4 dedicated solely to explaining the proposed model, its instruments, and hypothesis development. The current Chapters 4 (Data Analysis) and 5 (Discussion) should then be combined into a single, more cohesive chapter. Within this new combined chapter, the student was instructed to add a comparative analysis, using existing literature to contrast their findings for ordinary universities with studies on other university types to highlight the novelty and significance of their results.
- **Conclusion, Appendices, Abstract, and Title:** In the final part of the review, the panel advised that the conclusion should be a concise summary of findings, not a lengthy repetition. They mandated the removal of all personal identifying information (names, emails, photos) from the appendices to protect respondent privacy. The abstract was criticized as being too generic and proposal-like; it needs to be rewritten to specifically outline the mixed-methodology, key results, and the model's novelty. Finally, the panel concluded that the original title, which mentioned "effectiveness," was misleading. They guided the student toward a new title that accurately reflects the research's true contribution: the development of a "Conceptual Model" or "User-Related Determinant Model" for MIS adoption in ordinary Chinese universities.
