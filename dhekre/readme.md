# PhD Project:

A This repository contains the source code and data for my PhD project, which is being conducted within the Engineering Field, specifically in the Faculty of Computing, and as part of the Doctor of Philosophy (Informatics Engineering) program. My research topic focuses on the prediction of thyroid diseases using machine learning techniques. Thyroid diseases are common endocrine disorders that affect millions of people worldwide, and early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms and the vast amount of data available, this project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify the presence of thyroid diseases, thereby aiding healthcare professionals in making better-informed decisions and improving patient outcomes.

|1/ 06-3-2023|(Pal et al., 2022)| It highlights the importance of early detection for effective treatment of thyroid disorders, and how machine learning can aid in disease prediction and detection. The main objective of the study mentioned is to predict thyroid disease using machine learning classifiers. The text is organized into sections covering related work, methods, results, and conclusion.|The article discusses the comparison of three machine learning algorithms, namely KNN, Decision tree, and MLP for the prediction of thyroid disease. The results showed that MLP performed better in predicting thyroid disease compared to the other two algorithms, with an accuracy of 95.72% and an AUC of 94.23%. The study compared the proposed work with other existing studies and found that the proposed work performs better in the prediction of thyroid disease. The limitations of the ML classifiers were also discussed, and it was suggested that the used machine learning model could also be used for the classification of other chronic diseases with higher accuracy and diagnosis rate. The article concludes that using deep learning methods could further improve the accuracy of prediction of thyroid disease.|
