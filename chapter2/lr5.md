# **Sample Critical Synthesis Paragraphs (Before vs. After)**


## **Example 1: Technology Adoption Literature**

### ❌ **Before (Descriptive / Weak)**

Several studies have examined technology adoption in information systems. Davis (1989) introduced the Technology Acceptance Model, which explains system usage through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Venkatesh et al. (2003) extended this model into UTAUT. Other researchers such as DeLone and McLean (2003) also discussed system success. Many studies found that perceived usefulness influences intention to use.

### ✅ **After (Critical Synthesis / PhD-Level)**

Prior research on technology adoption in information systems has predominantly drawn upon **TAM** and its extensions, particularly **UTAUT**, to explain user intention and usage behaviour. While these models consistently demonstrate the significance of **perceived usefulness**, empirical findings reveal notable contextual variation. Studies conducted in Western settings report strong direct effects, whereas evidence from **Middle Eastern contexts** remains limited and sometimes inconsistent, suggesting potential cultural and institutional influences that are not explicitly accounted for in the original models. Furthermore, existing studies often treat perceived usefulness in isolation, with limited integration of system-level and organisational factors. This gap highlights the need for a context-sensitive examination of technology adoption that extends beyond individual perceptions, particularly within Middle Eastern organisations.


## **Example 2: System Quality and User Satisfaction**

### ❌ **Before (Summary-Based)**

DeLone and McLean (2003) stated that system quality is important for information systems success. Many researchers found that system quality affects user satisfaction. Petter et al. (2008) also supported this relationship. Therefore, system quality is an important factor in information systems.

### ✅ **After (Analytical and Comparative)**

The relationship between **system quality** and **user satisfaction** is well established within the **DeLone and McLean IS Success Model**, with multiple empirical studies confirming a positive association. However, a closer examination of the literature reveals methodological limitations, as many studies rely on cross-sectional designs and self-reported measures, potentially inflating observed effects. Moreover, studies conducted in **Middle Eastern environments** often overlook contextual factors such as infrastructure maturity and organisational readiness, which may condition user perceptions of system quality. These limitations suggest that while system quality is a necessary condition for user satisfaction, it may not be sufficient in isolation, thereby warranting a more nuanced investigation that incorporates contextual and organisational variables.


## **Example 3: Trust in Information Systems**

### ❌ **Before (Listing Studies)**

Trust has been studied by many researchers. Gefen et al. (2003) found that trust influences system usage. McKnight et al. (2011) also studied trust in online systems. In the Middle East, some studies mentioned trust as an important factor.

### ✅ **After (Synthesis with Gap Identification)**

Trust has emerged as a critical construct in explaining user behaviour in information systems, particularly in environments characterised by uncertainty. While studies such as Gefen et al. (2003) and McKnight et al. (2011) demonstrate the importance of trust in influencing system usage, the literature reveals an under-theorisation of trust within **Middle Eastern contexts**. Existing studies frequently operationalise trust as a direct predictor of intention, with limited exploration of its potential **mediating or moderating roles**. This narrow treatment restricts theoretical advancement and fails to capture the complexity of trust formation in collectivist and institution-driven environments, thereby justifying its reconceptualisation in the present study.



## **Example 4: Empirical Studies – Global vs. Middle East**

### ❌ **Before (Disconnected Review)**

Several studies have been conducted globally on information systems adoption. Some studies were conducted in Europe and the United States, while others were conducted in the Middle East. The results of these studies show that information systems adoption is important.

### ✅ **After (Comparative and Context-Aware)**

Empirical studies on information systems adoption demonstrate substantial variation between **global** and **Middle Eastern** contexts. While studies conducted in Europe and North America largely emphasise individual-level determinants, such as perceived usefulness and ease of use, research in the Middle East increasingly highlights the role of **institutional support**, **regulatory frameworks**, and **organisational culture**. Despite these insights, the literature remains fragmented, with limited comparative analysis across regions. This fragmentation constrains generalisability and underscores the need for an integrated framework that explicitly accounts for contextual differences.



## **Example 5: SLR Findings to Research Gap**

### ❌ **Before (Reporting Results Only)**

The systematic literature review found that many studies used TAM and UTAUT. Most studies were quantitative. Some studies were conducted in developing countries.

### ✅ **After (Interpretive and Gap-Driven)**

Findings from the **Systematic Literature Review** indicate a strong reliance on **TAM** and **UTAUT**, with a predominant use of quantitative survey-based methods. While this reflects methodological maturity, it also reveals a lack of theoretical diversity and limited contextual adaptation. Notably, only a small proportion of studies explicitly examined **Middle Eastern settings**, and even fewer incorporated institutional or cultural variables. These patterns suggest a systematic bias towards Western-centric models, thereby reinforcing the need for a contextually grounded investigation that addresses these theoretical and empirical shortcomings.

### ✅ **Supervisor Tip for Students**

A quick self-check:

> If you remove the citations and the paragraph still makes sense, you are doing **critical synthesis**.
