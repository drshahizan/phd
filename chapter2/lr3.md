# **Common Examiner Criticism vs. Ideal Response (Chapter 2 – Literature Review)**

| **Common Examiner Criticism**                                                 | **What the Examiner Really Means**| **Ideal Candidate Response (Viva-Ready)**|
| -- | -- |  |
| *“This chapter is too descriptive.”*                                          | You summarised studies without analysing or synthesising them. | **“I acknowledge this concern. I revised the chapter to synthesise studies thematically, comparing findings, methodologies, and contexts rather than listing individual studies. I also highlighted contradictions and gaps that directly informed my conceptual framework.”**                      |
| *“You have reviewed many papers, but I do not see a clear research gap.”*     | The novelty of the study is not explicit.                      | **“The research gap is derived from the SLR findings, which reveal limited empirical validation of the proposed relationships in Middle Eastern contexts and inconsistent results across prior studies. These gaps are summarised in Section 2.6.4.”**                                              |
| *“Why did you choose this theory and not others?”*                            | The theoretical justification is weak.                         | **“I selected this theory because it has been widely validated in IS research and aligns closely with the study objectives. However, my review also shows that its application in Middle Eastern contexts is limited, which justifies its re-examination and contextual extension in this study.”** |
| *“Your SLR looks like a table of papers rather than a synthesis.”*            | You reported results without interpretation.                   | **“I used the tables to summarise patterns, but the key contribution lies in the interpretive synthesis, where I identified dominant themes, methodological trends, and theoretical limitations that informed my framework development.”**                                                          |
| *“The Middle East context is mentioned, but not clearly justified.”*          | Contextual relevance is superficial.                           | **“The Middle East context is justified based on institutional, cultural, and regulatory differences identified in the literature. My review demonstrates that findings from Western contexts cannot be directly generalised, creating a clear need for context-specific investigation.”**          |
| *“Some constructs appear to overlap conceptually.”*                           | Definitions are unclear or inconsistent.                       | **“I refined the construct definitions by comparing alternative conceptualisations and clearly specifying their operational meanings in the study, ensuring conceptual distinction and measurement clarity.”**                                                                                      |
| *“You rely heavily on a small number of authors.”*                            | Literature coverage may be biased or narrow.                   | **“I expanded the review to include a broader range of high-impact studies from Q1/Q2 journals and cross-validated key arguments across multiple independent sources.”**                                                                                                                            |
| *“The conceptual framework appears intuitive rather than literature-driven.”* | The framework lacks strong grounding.                          | **“Each construct and relationship in the framework is supported by multiple empirical and theoretical studies. I explicitly mapped these sources in the literature synthesis section to demonstrate traceability.”**                                                                               |
| *“Why are some studies excluded from your SLR?”*                              | Transparency and rigour are questioned.                        | **“All exclusions followed predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in the SLR protocol. This ensured methodological consistency and reduced selection bias.”**                                                                                                                         |
| *“Your literature review and methodology do not seem well aligned.”*          | There is a disconnect between chapters.                        | **“The constructs reviewed in Chapter 2 directly inform the research questions, hypotheses, and measurement instruments described in Chapter 3, ensuring alignment between theory and method.”**                                                                                                    |
| *“This chapter reads like a Master’s-level review.”*                          | Depth and originality are insufficient.                        | **“I strengthened the chapter by integrating an SLR, critically comparing theories, identifying context-specific gaps, and explicitly demonstrating how the study advances existing knowledge.”**                                                                                                   |
| *“You cite many papers, but your own voice is missing.”*                      | Lack of independent scholarly thinking.                        | **“I revised the chapter to emphasise analytical commentary, clearly stating my evaluation of prior work and explaining how my study builds upon and extends the literature.”**                                                                                                                     |
| *“The contribution of Chapter 2 is unclear.”*                                 | The chapter does not add value beyond summary.                 | **“Chapter 2 contributes by synthesising fragmented literature, identifying empirically grounded research gaps through SLR, and providing a justified conceptual framework tailored to the Middle East context.”**                                                                                  |



### 🎓 **Viva Survival Tip (Supervisor Advice)**

When responding to examiner criticism:

* **Acknowledge first** (never argue defensively)
* **Refer to evidence in the chapter** (sections, tables, figures)
* **Link every answer back to research gaps and contribution**
