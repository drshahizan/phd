# **CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW — EXAMINER CHECKLIST (UTM-STYLE)**



## **A. Structure and Organisation**

☐ The chapter has a **clear and logical structure**, progressing from **general concepts to specific issues** relevant to the study.

☐ Each section and subsection is **clearly labelled** and appropriately linked to the research focus.

☐ The chapter demonstrates a **coherent narrative flow**, avoiding abrupt transitions or disconnected discussions.

☐ Redundancy with **Chapter 1 (Introduction)** and **Chapter 3 (Methodology)** is minimal.



## **B. Coverage of Literature**

☐ The review covers **foundational, contemporary, and high-impact literature** relevant to the research domain.

☐ Sources are drawn primarily from **Q1/Q2 journals**, reputable conferences, and authoritative books.

☐ The literature adequately reflects both **global perspectives** and **Middle Eastern contexts**.

☐ Key studies relevant to the research problem are **not omitted**.



## **C. Conceptual and Terminological Clarity**

☐ **Key concepts and constructs** are clearly defined using authoritative sources.

☐ Multiple definitions are compared where relevant, with **justification for the adopted definition**.

☐ Terminology is used **consistently throughout the chapter**.

☐ Constructs are clearly distinguished from one another, avoiding conceptual overlap.



## **D. Theoretical Foundations**

☐ The chapter clearly identifies the **theories and models** underpinning the study.

☐ The **assumptions, strengths, and limitations** of each theory are critically discussed.

☐ The suitability of the selected theory/theories for the **Middle East context** is justified.

☐ Theoretical gaps or limitations motivating the current research are explicitly stated.



## **E. Empirical Literature Review**

☐ Empirical studies are **synthesised thematically**, not listed author-by-author.

☐ Research methodologies, contexts, and key findings are **critically compared**.

☐ Differences between **global studies and Middle Eastern studies** are clearly articulated.

☐ Methodological weaknesses and inconsistencies in prior studies are identified.



## **F. Systematic Literature Review (SLR)**

☐ The rationale for adopting a **Systematic Literature Review** is clearly justified.

☐ The **SLR protocol** (databases, search strings, inclusion/exclusion criteria) is transparently described.

☐ The SLR findings are **synthesised**, not merely tabulated or summarised.

☐ Research gaps identified through the SLR are **clearly linked to the research problem**.

☐ The SLR is **integrated into the overall literature review**, not treated as an isolated exercise.



## **G. Critical Analysis and Synthesis**

☐ The chapter demonstrates **critical evaluation** rather than descriptive reporting.

☐ Conflicting findings in the literature are acknowledged and discussed.

☐ The review highlights **what is known, what is contested, and what is unknown**.

☐ The discussion moves beyond “what has been done” to “**why it matters**”.



## **H. Conceptual Framework Development**

☐ The proposed **conceptual framework** is clearly derived from the reviewed literature.

☐ Each construct and relationship in the framework is **supported by multiple credible sources**.

☐ The framework addresses **identified research gaps**, particularly in the Middle East context.

☐ The framework is logically aligned with the **research questions and objectives**.



## **I. Alignment with Research Design**

☐ The literature review provides a **clear rationale** for the chosen research approach.

☐ Constructs discussed in Chapter 2 are **fully aligned** with variables examined in later chapters.

☐ There is no mismatch between the literature review and the **methodology**.



## **J. Academic Writing Quality**

☐ The writing is **formal, precise, and coherent**, suitable for PhD-level work.

☐ Citations and referencing follow **UTM-approved academic standards**.

☐ Arguments are logically developed and well supported by evidence.

☐ The chapter demonstrates **independent scholarly thinking**.



## **K. Overall Examiner Judgment**

☐ The chapter demonstrates **doctoral-level depth and rigour**.

☐ The literature review convincingly establishes the **need and originality** of the study.

☐ The chapter provides a **strong foundation** for the conceptual framework and methodology.

☐ The chapter is suitable for progression to **viva voce examination**.



### 🎓 **Supervisor/Viva Preparation Tip**

If the candidate can confidently explain:

* **Why specific theories were chosen**,
* **How the SLR revealed gaps**, and
* **How the framework logically emerges from the literature**,

then Chapter 2 is generally **examiner-ready**.
