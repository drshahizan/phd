# **Mapping Table: Literature → Constructs → Hypotheses**

## **Purpose of the Table**

This table illustrates how **constructs and hypotheses** are **systematically derived from the literature**, ensuring that the proposed research model is **theory-driven and evidence-based**, rather than intuitive.



## **Literature–Construct–Hypothesis Mapping**

| **Key Literature Source(s)**                  | **Theory / Model**            | **Key Findings from Literature**                                                                            | **Derived Construct(s)**  | **Proposed Hypothesis**                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Davis (1989); Venkatesh et al. (2003)         | **TAM / UTAUT**               | Perceived usefulness and ease of use significantly influence users’ intention to adopt information systems. | **Perceived Usefulness**  | **H1:** Perceived usefulness has a positive effect on users’ intention to use the system.                             |
| DeLone & McLean (2003); Petter et al. (2008)  | **IS Success Model**          | System quality directly influences user satisfaction and system usage.                                      | **System Quality**        | **H2:** System quality has a positive effect on user satisfaction.                                                    |
| DeLone & McLean (2003)                        | **IS Success Model**          | High-quality information enhances user trust and satisfaction.                                              | **Information Quality**   | **H3:** Information quality has a positive effect on user satisfaction.                                               |
| Gefen et al. (2003); McKnight et al. (2011)   | **Trust Theory**              | Trust plays a critical role in reducing uncertainty and increasing system adoption.                         | **User Trust**            | **H4:** User trust has a positive effect on intention to use the system.                                              |
| Venkatesh et al. (2012)                       | **UTAUT2**                    | Social influence significantly affects technology adoption, especially in collectivist cultures.            | **Social Influence**      | **H5:** Social influence positively affects intention to use the system.                                              |
| Goodhue & Thompson (1995)                     | **Task–Technology Fit (TTF)** | A better fit between task requirements and system functionality improves performance outcomes.              | **Task–Technology Fit**   | **H6:** Task–technology fit has a positive effect on user performance.                                                |
| DeLone & McLean (2016); Rai et al. (2002)     | **IS Success Model**          | User satisfaction mediates the relationship between system characteristics and net benefits.                | **User Satisfaction**     | **H7:** User satisfaction positively affects net benefits.                                                            |
| Institutional studies in Middle East contexts | **Institutional Theory**      | Organisational and regulatory environments influence IS adoption in the Middle East.                        | **Institutional Support** | **H8:** Institutional support positively moderates the relationship between intention to use and actual system usage. |



## **Optional: Context-Specific Extension (Highly Recommended for PhD)**

| **SLR-Based Evidence**                   | **Observed Gap**                         | **Extended Construct / Relationship**         | **Additional Hypothesis**                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Limited Middle East empirical validation | Contextual bias towards Western settings | Cultural or regulatory factors not integrated | **H9:** Cultural context moderates the relationship between perceived usefulness and intention to use. |
| Inconsistent findings on trust           | Measurement inconsistency                | Trust rarely modelled as mediator             | **H10:** User trust mediates the relationship between system quality and intention to use.             |



## **How Examiners Interpret This Table**

✔ Demonstrates **clear lineage from literature to hypotheses**
✔ Shows **independent analytical thinking**
✔ Confirms that hypotheses are **not arbitrarily formulated**
✔ Strengthens **construct validity and theoretical justification**



## **Supervisor Tips (Very Important)**

* Each hypothesis should be supported by **at least 2–3 high-quality sources**
* Avoid one-to-one mapping (1 paper → 1 hypothesis)
* Explicitly reference this table in text:

  > *“Table X summarises how the proposed constructs and hypotheses are derived from prior literature.”*
