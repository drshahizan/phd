# **Checklist: Converting Descriptive Writing into Critical Synthesis**



## **A. Structural Transformation**

☐ **Grouped studies by theme, not by author**
❌ *“Smith (2020) studied… Jones (2021) found…”*
✅ *“Prior studies examining system quality consistently report…”*

☐ **Each paragraph has one clear analytical focus**
→ One concept, one relationship, or one debate per paragraph.

☐ **Paragraphs follow a logic chain**
**Theme → Evidence → Comparison → Evaluation → Gap**



## **B. Analytical Depth**

☐ **Compared findings across studies**
→ Highlight **similarities, differences, and contradictions**.

☐ **Explained why findings differ**
→ Context, methodology, sample, theory, or measurement differences.

☐ **Moved beyond ‘what’ to ‘why’**
Ask: *Why does this finding matter for the research problem?*



## **C. Use of Evidence**

☐ **Used multiple sources to support one argument**
→ Avoid one-study-one-claim writing.

☐ **Prioritised high-impact and recent studies**
→ Q1/Q2 journals, seminal works, and authoritative reviews.

☐ **Integrated SLR findings into the discussion**
→ Refer to patterns, trends, and gaps, not paper counts.



## **D. Critical Voice (Candidate’s Voice)**

☐ **Explicitly evaluated prior studies**
Use phrases such as:

* *“However, existing studies tend to…”*
* *“This approach overlooks…”*
* *“These findings remain inconclusive because…”*

☐ **Avoided neutral reporting tone**
❌ *“The study found that…”*
✅ *“While these findings suggest…, they are limited by…”*

☐ **Demonstrated independent judgement**
→ Examiner must “hear” the candidate’s thinking.



## **E. Theory Integration**

☐ **Linked findings back to theory**
→ Explain how results **support, extend, or challenge** existing theories.

☐ **Identified theoretical limitations**
→ Over-reliance on TAM/UTAUT, lack of contextualisation, etc.

☐ **Justified theory selection**
→ Why this theory is suitable (or insufficient) for the Middle East context.



## **F. Contextual Awareness (Middle East Focus)**

☐ **Avoided assuming Western generalisability**
→ Explicitly discussed cultural, institutional, or regulatory differences.

☐ **Compared global vs Middle Eastern findings**
→ Highlighted convergence and divergence.

☐ **Used context to justify research gap**
→ Not just “few studies exist,” but *why that matters*.



## **G. Research Gap Identification**

☐ **Clearly stated what is missing in the literature**
Examples:

* Under-researched constructs
* Inconsistent empirical results
* Weak methodological designs
* Lack of contextual validation

☐ **Linked each gap to the current study**
→ Every gap must point to *what this research will do*.

☐ **Avoided vague gap statements**
❌ *“More research is needed.”*
✅ *“Existing studies rarely examine…, particularly in…”*



## **H. Conceptual Framework Readiness**

☐ **Each construct discussed supports the framework**
→ No “orphan” constructs with no role later.

☐ **Relationships are literature-driven**
→ Supported by multiple sources and SLR evidence.

☐ **Paragraphs naturally lead to hypotheses**
→ Reader can predict the hypothesis before seeing it.



## **I. Paragraph-Level Self-Test (Must Pass All)**

For each paragraph, ask:

☐ Does this paragraph **make an argument**, not just report studies?
☐ Can I identify a **clear theme or claim**?
☐ Do I explain **why this literature matters** for my study?
☐ Is there at least **one evaluative sentence**?
☐ Does this paragraph help justify my **framework or hypotheses**?

If **any answer is “No”**, the paragraph is still descriptive.



## **J. Examiner Red Flags (Avoid These)**

🚫 Long paragraphs listing many authors without comparison
🚫 Repeating tables in text without interpretation
🚫 Excessive quotations
🚫 Generic closing sentences (*“Therefore, this is important”*)
🚫 No link to research objectives



## 🎓 **Supervisor Gold Rule**

> **Description informs. Synthesis convinces.**

If the paragraph convinces the examiner that:

* the **gap is real**,
* the **theory is justified**, and
* the **study is necessary**,

then it has achieved **critical synthesis**.



If you wish, I can:

* Apply this checklist to **your student’s real Chapter 2 text**
* Convert one **weak paragraph → examiner-ready version**
* Create a **one-page “critical synthesis writing template”**

Just tell me what you’d like next.
