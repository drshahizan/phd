# **CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW**



## **2.1 Introduction**

This chapter critically reviews and synthesises existing literature related to the research domain in **Information Systems (IS)**. The purpose of the literature review is to establish a **theoretical foundation**, examine **empirical evidence**, identify **research gaps**, and justify the **novelty and significance** of the present study. Both **narrative literature review** and **Systematic Literature Review (SLR)** approaches are employed, with particular emphasis on studies conducted in the **Middle Eastern context**.

**Supervisor Tip (Critical Writing):**
Avoid listing studies one by one. Instead, compare how scholars **conceptualise the problem**, **approach it methodologically**, and **interpret findings**.



## **2.2 Overview of the Research Domain**

This section provides a conceptual overview of the **research domain** within Information Systems. It discusses the **evolution**, **current trends**, and **key challenges** reported in the literature.

Typical focus areas may include:

* **Information systems adoption and usage**
* **Digital transformation in organisations**
* **Technology-enabled organisational performance**
* **Data-driven and intelligent information systems**
* **User behaviour and decision-making**

The discussion explicitly highlights how these themes are addressed within **Middle Eastern organisations**, considering **cultural**, **institutional**, and **regulatory** factors.

**Supervisor Tip (Critical Synthesis):**
Group studies by **themes**, not by authors. Highlight **similarities, contradictions, and missing perspectives** across regions.



## **2.3 Key Concepts and Definitions**

This section defines and clarifies the **key concepts and constructs** used in the study, drawing from **authoritative and highly cited sources**.

Typical content includes:

* Conceptual definition of **Information Systems** in the study context
* Definitions of core constructs such as **system quality**, **information quality**, **user satisfaction**, **trust**, **intention to use**, and **organisational performance**
* Comparison of **alternative definitions** used in prior studies

The section concludes by stating the **operational definitions** adopted in the current research.

**Supervisor Tip (Critical Writing):**
Do not merely quote definitions. Explain **why a particular definition is more appropriate** for the Middle East context.



## **2.4 Theoretical Foundations and Relevant Models**

This section reviews the **theoretical frameworks and models** underpinning the study. Each theory is discussed in terms of its **core constructs**, **assumptions**, **strengths**, and **limitations**.

Commonly applied theories in IS research include:

* **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)**
* **Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT / UTAUT2)**
* **DeLone and McLean IS Success Model**
* **Diffusion of Innovation Theory**
* **Task–Technology Fit (TTF) Model**
* **Institutional Theory**

Where relevant, the section reviews how these theories have been **applied, adapted, or extended** in **Middle Eastern studies**.

**Supervisor Tip (Critical Synthesis):**
Highlight **theoretical gaps**—for example, theories validated in Western contexts but **under-tested or inconsistently supported** in the Middle East.



## **2.5 Review of Empirical Studies**

This section critically examines **empirical studies** related to the research topic, focusing on **methods, findings, and limitations**.

### **2.5.1 Empirical Studies in Global Contexts**

This subsection reviews studies conducted in **international and cross-country settings**, highlighting dominant research designs, commonly used constructs, and major findings.

### **2.5.2 Empirical Studies in Middle Eastern Contexts**

This subsection focuses on studies conducted in **Middle Eastern countries**, examining:

* Contextual characteristics
* Methodological choices
* Consistency or divergence of findings compared to global studies

**Supervisor Tip (Critical Synthesis):**
Explicitly compare **global vs Middle Eastern findings**. Identify whether differences arise due to **culture, governance, infrastructure, or organisational maturity**.



## **2.6 Systematic Literature Review (SLR)**

### **2.6.1 Rationale for Conducting a Systematic Literature Review**

This subsection justifies the use of **SLR** by addressing limitations of traditional narrative reviews, such as **selection bias** and **lack of transparency**. It explains how SLR ensures **rigour, reproducibility, and comprehensive coverage** of relevant studies.

**Supervisor Tip:**
Clearly state that the SLR is used to **objectively identify patterns and gaps**, not just to increase the number of reviewed papers.



### **2.6.2 SLR Protocol**

This subsection outlines the **SLR protocol**, including:

* **SLR research questions**
* **Databases** (e.g., Scopus, Web of Science)
* **Search strings and keywords**
* **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**
* **Screening and selection process**

(Methodological details may be summarised here and elaborated in **Chapter 3**.)



### **2.6.3 Findings from the SLR**

This subsection synthesises results from the selected studies, focusing on:

* **Dominant research themes**
* **Frequently studied constructs**
* **Common theoretical frameworks**
* **Research methods and analytical techniques**

Tables and figures are recommended to summarise patterns and trends.

**Supervisor Tip (Critical Synthesis):**
Do not restate tables in text. Instead, **interpret what the patterns mean** for theory and practice.



### **2.6.4 Research Gaps Identified through the SLR**

This critical subsection identifies gaps such as:

* **Under-researched constructs or relationships**
* **Inconsistent or inconclusive findings**
* **Methodological weaknesses**
* **Limited contextual focus on Middle Eastern environments**

These gaps provide a **clear and evidence-based justification** for the present study.



## **2.7 Synthesis of Literature and Conceptual Framework Development**

This section integrates insights from:

* **Theoretical foundations**
* **Empirical studies**
* **SLR findings**

It explains how the **proposed constructs and relationships** are derived and leads to the development of the **conceptual framework**, explicitly linking it to the **Middle East case study**.

**Supervisor Tip (Critical Writing):**
Each construct in the framework must be traceable to **multiple high-quality sources**, not a single study.



## **2.8 Summary**

This section summarises the key insights from the literature review and explains how they inform the **research questions, hypotheses, and methodological approach** presented in subsequent chapters.



### ✅ **Key Examiner Expectations for Chapter 2**

* Evidence of **critical synthesis**, not descriptive listing
* Strong **theory–context alignment**
* Clear **justification of research gaps**
* Logical flow from **literature → framework → research design**
