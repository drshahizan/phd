## **Importance and Purpose of Chapter 2 (Literature Review)**

**Chapter 2 is a critical component of a doctoral thesis** because it establishes the **intellectual foundation** of the research. This chapter demonstrates the candidate’s ability to **engage critically with existing knowledge**, position the study within the relevant academic discourse, and justify the **theoretical and empirical necessity** of the research.

More importantly, Chapter 2 is where the candidate proves that the research problem **does not emerge in isolation**, but rather arises from **unresolved issues, inconsistencies, and gaps** identified in prior studies. A well-written Chapter 2 directly supports the **conceptual framework, hypotheses, and methodological choices** presented in later chapters.



## **Common Misconception: Chapter 2 as a “Textbook Chapter”**

A common weakness observed among postgraduate students is the tendency to write Chapter 2 **as if it were a textbook or reference book**, where theories, models, and studies are described extensively but **without critical evaluation**.

This approach is **academically incorrect for doctoral-level work**.

Chapter 2 should **not aim to teach the reader everything about the topic**, nor should it attempt to summarise all existing literature. Instead, it must **select, evaluate, compare, and synthesise** relevant studies to support a **clear research argument**.

> **Key principle:**
> *A thesis literature review is not about how much the student knows, but how well the student thinks.*



## **Use of Tables: Existing Models and Prior Studies**

In Chapter 2, it is common and appropriate to include **tables summarising existing models, frameworks, or empirical studies**. These tables serve as **organisational and comparative tools** to help readers understand the landscape of prior research.

However, **tables must never stand alone**.

After presenting any table (e.g., comparison of existing models), the candidate **must provide a critical synthesis** that addresses questions such as:

* What patterns emerge across these models?
* What constructs are repeatedly emphasised or neglected?
* What theoretical or contextual limitations can be observed?
* Why are existing models insufficient for the current research context?

Simply describing what is shown in the table is **insufficient**. The table should act as **evidence**, while the accompanying text provides **interpretation and evaluation**.



## **Required Synthesis after Literature Tables**

After each table, the discussion should:

1. **Summarise key trends**, not individual entries
2. **Compare and contrast models or findings**, highlighting similarities and differences
3. **Evaluate limitations**, such as narrow contexts, theoretical bias, or methodological weaknesses
4. **Link explicitly to the research gap** and justify the need for the current study

> **Examiner expectation:**
> The reader should clearly understand **why existing models are inadequate** and **how the present study advances the literature**.



## **Practical Tips for Writing Chapter 2 Effectively**

### **Tip 1: Write with a Clear Purpose**

Every section and paragraph in Chapter 2 should answer at least one of the following:

* What is already known?
* What is contested or inconsistent?
* What is missing?
* Why does this matter for my research?

If a paragraph does not contribute to answering these questions, it should be revised or removed.



### **Tip 2: Use Thematic, Not Author-Based, Writing**

Avoid writing paragraphs that list authors and years. Instead, organise the review around **themes, constructs, or debates**, supported by multiple sources.



### **Tip 3: Make the Candidate’s Voice Visible**

The examiner should be able to distinguish between:

* **What previous researchers claimed**, and
* **What the candidate concludes** based on those claims.

Use evaluative language such as *however*, *nevertheless*, *this suggests*, and *this indicates a limitation*.



### **Tip 4: Explicitly Justify the Research Gap**

Avoid generic statements such as *“more research is needed.”*
Instead, clearly explain:

* What is missing
* Where it is missing (context, method, theory)
* Why it matters academically and practically



### **Tip 5: Ensure Direct Linkage to the Conceptual Framework**

Every major construct discussed in Chapter 2 should later appear in:

* The conceptual framework
* The hypotheses or research questions

There should be **no disconnect** between Chapter 2 and subsequent chapters.



### **Tip 6: Remember the Examiner’s Perspective**

Examiners do not ask:

> *“How many papers did you read?”*

They ask:

> *“Why does your study need to exist?”*

Chapter 2 must convincingly answer this question.



## **Final Reminder for Students**

> **A strong Chapter 2 does not impress by volume,
> but convinces through clarity, critique, and coherence.**

If Chapter 2 successfully demonstrates:

* Critical engagement with literature
* Clear identification of research gaps
* Logical justification of the proposed framework

then it has fulfilled its doctoral purpose.
